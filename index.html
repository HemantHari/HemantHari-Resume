        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Hemant Hari and I am a finance accounting major graduated from the University of California Riverside. I have work experience in retail and sales as well as internships at two of the big four accounting firms PWC and EY. Not only this I have experience in student government serving as a Senator my second year, the marketing promotions director my third year, and the Executive Vice President my fourth year. I was a part of the Accounting Society a prestigious and inclusive club at the university as well. I was also a member of the top chapter of the most preferred fratrneity in the nation Kappa Sigma. I held numerous positions throught the years in the fraternity such as Events Director, New Member Education Chair, and Marketing Chair. Throught college I have grown not only professionaly but matured as an individual too taking part in philanthropic events and team projects such as the Juju Smith schuster, (an NFL player), charity event where we raised over 100  thousand dollars for children in need and team building excercises such as working with other members in ASUCR the university student body on projects to better the school and improve quality of life for students. Since I was a child I was always focused on being ahead of the curve and trying my utmost to be the top at everything I do much like most other people. But what set me apart was the unrivaling drive and passion I had for the things I did. Any task at hand I would make sure nobody would outwork me and thats how I would win. I learned this from watching one of my favorite basketball players and one of the men I looked up to the most in this world, Kobe Bryant. The focused and steadfast mentality to be the hardest worker in every room you walked into so you could reap the rewards and boast your results is what I focus on everyday. Some other qualities that set me apart from the crowd other than my passion mentality and work ethic are my listening and executing skills. I am good in group settings or any work evnviornment really and I can listen to what needs to be done and execute the task really well. I picked these skills up working multiple jobs in retail. My time in the workforce gave me the neccasry skills to be able to take any job and immediatley be accustomed to the work enviornment and perform to the highest of standards immediately. All these qualities and all this experience both in the workforce and in the Univeristy allong with the accolades and positions held through internships and clubs and organizations make me the best fit for this job. I have aced all my finanace and accounting classes as well as all of my buisness related classes in the University meaning school and the tasks I would need to do for the buisness related job have all been learned and can be passed easily with flying colors as I have already done this. Not only this but I have done well in all the leadership and job positions as well as internship positions I have held and have letters of reccomendation from the supervisors at all of them to bolster my candidacy and set me apart. <br><br>
